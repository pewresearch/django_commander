Django Commander
===================================================================

Django Commander allows you to easily create, organize, and log management commands and subcommands.
You might wonder why you may need something that goes above and beyond the traditional Django management
command system.  Here are some things that Django Commander does that you can't do with out-of-the-box Django:

    #. Organize and nest your management commands into subfolders and easily access them from the command line with no hassle
    #. Automatically log commands that get run
    #. Use a standardized system for loading and processing data
    #. Keep track of the objects in your database that get modified by each command
    #. Easily run your commands programmatically and have them return values
